## About me
Postdoctoral research fellow working on theoretical and computational fluid dynamics. My research spans from instability and bifurcation analysis to biomedical simulation. Passionate about using mathematics to understand real-world problems. Currently mystified by fluid flow in the brain and its role in preventing Alzheimer’s disease.
